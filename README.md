# 👋 Hi, I’m @jmarlon (Jennifer Marlon)

## 🌍 Researcher | Data Scientist | Science Communicator

I am a **Senior Research Scientist & Lecturer** at the Yale School of the Environment and the **Executive Director** of the Yale Center for Geospatial Solutions. My work focuses on **climate change, public opinion, and data-driven communication**.

I lead research and the development of **interactive data visualization tools** that help translate climate science into actionable insights.

### 🔥 What I Work On
- **Paleofire & Climate History** 🌿🔥  
  Investigating past wildfires and their relationship to climate change using charcoal records and paleoclimatic data.  
- **Understanding Risk Perception** 🌎🔍  
  Studying how people perceive climate risks and how to communicate uncertainty effectively for better decision-making.  

Some of my projects include:

### 🔹 Interactive Data & Maps
- **[Yale Climate Opinion Maps (U.S.)](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/)**  
  Mapping public beliefs, risk perceptions, and climate policy support across the United States.  

- **[Six Americas Maps (SASSY)](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/sassy/)**  
  A tool for exploring climate attitudes and engagement levels across different audience segments.  

- **[Climate Opinions in India Maps](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycomindia/)**  
  A comprehensive look at Indian public opinions on climate change and energy policies.  

- **[Climate Opinions in Ireland Maps](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ireland-climate-opinion-maps/)**  
  Visualizing Irish public perceptions, concerns, and policy support for climate action.  

### 📑 Factsheets & Reports
- **[U.S. Climate Opinion Factsheets](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/factsheets/)**  
  State, congressional district, and county-level insights into how Americans perceive climate change, its risks, and solutions.  

- **[India Climate Opinion Factsheets](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/india-factsheets/)**  
  Regional-level data on Indian public awareness, concern, and support for climate policies.  

## 🔬 My Work & Interests
- **Climate change & public perception** 🏞️📊  
- **Geospatial analysis & data visualization** 🗺️📈  
- **Science communication & engagement** 🗣️💡  

I am always exploring new ways to **bridge data, maps, and storytelling** to inform climate policy and action.
